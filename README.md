# Image-Segmentation using K-Means
Through image segmentation, an image can be partitioned into multiple segments. The goal of segmenting an image is to change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze

## K Means Clustering algorithm
K Means is a clustering algorithm that is unsupervised algorithm which means that there is no labelled data available. It is used to identify different classes or clusters in the given data based on how similar the data is. Data points in the same group are more similar to other data points in that same group than those in other groups.

## Dominant colour extraction
Here by using K-Means Clustering algorithm, dominant K colours are extracted and then each pixel will get reassigned to the closest of the K colours leading to segmentation.
